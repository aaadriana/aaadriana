# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/L1R1tvI9svkIWwpVYr/giphy.gif)

## My name is Adriana (she/her).

I was born right before Romania embraced democracy and I spent my childhood and teenage years watching my country learn what freedom means. 

I have a masters degree in Tourism Marketing and Management and I spent my twenties working in Sales & Marketing for a few pharmaceutical companies. 

I moved to London in 2017 with my husband and have tried to find something to be passionate about ever since.

My coding journey started in 2020 when I decided to experiment with online tutorials, in order to see if coding is something I can do and maybe become passionate about. I fell in love with it.

### Now I am happy to be part of the FAC22 Cohort [@foundersandcoders](https://github.com/foundersandcoders)
